Overview
This project implements and analyzes pharmacokinetic (PK) models—including two- and three-compartment systems—to simulate drug absorption, distribution, and elimination. The goal is to explore how different dosing strategies (IV bolus, IV infusion, oral dosing, and multidose regimens) influence drug concentration–time profiles and to validate model behaviour using known pharmacologic principles.

The project includes

Numerical ODE solvers (Euler, RK4)

Mass-conservation checks

Dose scheduling (bolus, continuous infusion, multidose)

Visualization of concentration curves

Basic Parameter editing
